# JavaAndCProfiling
Profiling assignment for Java and C for new engineers.

Please watch your Home Work Kapsules here:- http://kpoint.gslab.com/playlist/view/128

Submission of Assignment:-

1) After completion of assignment send corrected file to email: mahendra.patel@gslab.com

2) Only share the required files example only modified bst.c for Q1.
3) Please mention new complexity of Q2 in email.   

First Assignment:- C
Q1. C Debugging Assignment.  ( Code is present in eclipse on given VM at /gslab/workspace/C_debugging_assignment. Check the file bst.c )
	Below is Implementation for Binary search tree (present in file  bst.c eclipse project:C-debugging_assignment).  Unfortunately this code crashes(gives segmentation fault) at many places. find all such places and correct the code.


Note: 1) Your aim is to correct below code not to write new code, so just correct the error rather than replace the algorithm.
2)  Code is written in such fashion so it is easy to understand. Still if you want to know more about code algorithm and logic of binary search tree please refer appendix A below.

Second Assignemnt:- Java

Q2. Java Profiling & Debugging (The code is already added in eclipes)

Problem Statement: 
Find out the missing number from given set of numbers.  The size of the input can be anything. Numbers are in increasing order i.e a<b<c…..<n and difference between any two consecutive numbers is atmost 2.  

Ex: Input    : {2,3,4,6,7} 
      Output : 5

Implementation Details : 
This program reads the numbers from file (number are stored in comma (,) separated format)  and then prints out the missing number.  

Bug: This program has a bug. It won’t give desired output when input numbers are > 9. 

Assignment: 
1. fix the bug
2. Find out the time complexity of the current program.
3. profile the program  to improve the time complexity
4. find out the time complexity of improved version.
